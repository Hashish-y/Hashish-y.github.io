I am generally interested in most things having to do with galaxies, the interstellar medium, star formation, and stellar feedback. In astronomer-speak I am an "observer" meaning that I spend a lot of my energy planning new experiments using telescopes, executing the observations, and analyzing the results. Because of this focus, my current interests tend to follow current and upcoming facilities (or be focused on pushing for new facilities).

Topics I am currently very interested in:

* **Dust in galaxies.** I'm interest in how we can use emission from dust, especially the mid-infrared emission observed by the new JWST, to infer how stars and star clusters form and reshape the surrounding galaxy. I'm also interested in dust for dust's sake - this solid phase of the ISM holds about half the heavy elements in the universe and totally reshaps how galaxies look. We're in a golden era (literally!) that's very exciting. Before JWST I worked with data from Spitzer, Herschel, WISE, and even IRAS and COBE.

* **Molecular clouds and cold gas in galaxies** 

* **The physical state and detailed structure of atomic gas in galaxies**

* **Putting it all together - panchromatic surveys** 

* **Pushing current facilities to their limits** I am generally interested in trying to get the largest possible amount of science out of our telescopes. Over the years, my collaborators and I have used ALMA and the VLA to observe star clusters forming at super high resolution. We've also stared very depe with the Green Bank telescope to see the faintest wisps of HI in the circumgalactic medium. We developped clever stacking and statistical techniques to push the sensitivity of extragalactic mapping data to recover faint lines.
