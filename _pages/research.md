* **Research Intern** - MITACS GRI University of Alberta, Canada
under Prof. Gregory Sivakoff May 2023 - Aug 2023
  * Cross-Matched VLASS catalog with Gaia sub-sub-giants **(SSGs)** catalog to identify *transient* and variable events, to help
further in the study of **Globular Clusters**.
  * Performed analysis of VLASS FITS files in **Python** and **ds9**.
  * Developed computational pipeline for advanced data analysis and handling of large datasets of VLASS in Python.
  * Contributed to refining transient identification and classification using the VLASS data.

* **Indian Pulsar Timing Array Consortium (InPTA) Pune, India**
Associate Member June 2022 - Present
  * **Data Base Management:** Currently working with the National Center for Radio Astrophysics (NCRA) to develop and
manage upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) legacy database using *PostgreSQL*.
  * **Observational Radio Astronomy** Active observer for InPTA, conducting 50+ hours of observations using uGMRT.
  * **Raw Data Reduction:** Reducing raw data obtained from observations using Pinta pipeline.
* Member of **Gravitational Radiation and Science with Pulsars (GRASP)**, where interesting pulsar projects and papers are
discussed.
* **Superresolution and Satellite Track Removal in Astronomical Images** under Prof. Sumohanna Channappayya Jan-Mayâ€™23
    * Developed a novel method for generating high-resolution astronomical images from low-resolution, blurred observations while
effectively eliminating satellite trails using Hough Transform technique.
    * Conducted a comparative analysis between deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction techniques, specifically the
CNN process, and advanced wavelet-based methods.
    * Evaluated the performance of our approach using metrics such as PSNR, MSE, and SSIM, and provided a benchmark for future
research in this field.
