**Superresolution and Satellite Track Removal in Astronomical Images**

****under Prof. Sumohanna Channappayya Jan-Mayâ€™23****
    * Developed a novel method for generating high-resolution astronomical images from low-resolution, blurred observations while
effectively eliminating satellite trails using Hough Transform technique.
    * Conducted a comparative analysis between deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction techniques, specifically the
CNN process, and advanced wavelet-based methods.
    * Evaluated the performance of our approach using metrics such as PSNR, MSE, and SSIM, and provided a benchmark for future
research in this field
