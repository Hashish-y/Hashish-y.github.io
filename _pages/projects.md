**Superresolution and Satellite Track Removal in Astronomical Images**

<sub>*under Prof. Sumohanna Channappayya during                                  Jan-May’23*<sub>                               
    
   * Developed a novel method for generating high-resolution astronomical images from low-resolution, blurred observations while
effectively eliminating satellite trails using Hough Transform technique.
   * Conducted a comparative analysis between deep learning-based super-resolution reconstruction techniques, specifically the
CNN process, and advanced wavelet-based methods.
   * Evaluated the performance of our approach using metrics such as PSNR, MSE, and SSIM, and provided a benchmark for future
research in this field


**Residual Self-Interference Cancellation and Optimal Control with RIS for Full-Duplex Communication**
<sub>*under Prof. Zafar Ali Khan during Jan-May’23*</sub>

   * Implemented and analyzed Full-Duplex Communication Systems using Python to improve its reliability.
   * Conducted simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of the traditional method, superimposed method, and ’self-proposed’
method, demonstrating their potential to improve the performance of full-duplex communication systems.
   * Proposed practical solutions for enhancing wireless network performance, focusing on capacity and reliability improvements,
addressing challenges such as self-interference and transmit power consumption.


**Correlation Coefficients**
<sub>*under Prof. Shantanu Desai during Jan-May’22*</sub>

   * Conducted a statistical analysis of correlation coefficients, including Pearson’s sample correlation coefficient, Spearman rank
correlation coefficient, and Kendall Tau.
   * Analyzed the characteristics of each coefficient and their applications in exploratory data analysis, structural modeling, and
data engineering.
   * Demonstrated proficiency in data analysis and statistical modeling techniques, including hypothesis testing and regression analysis.
