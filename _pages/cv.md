I am a faculty member in the <u><a href="https://astronomy.osu.edu/">Department of Astronomy</a>.</u> at Ohio State University. We run a collaborative, collegial department. A scientific centerpiece of our department is our daily <u><a href="https://astronomy.osu.edu/talks/astro-coffee">Astronomy Coffee</a>.</u> 

Before joining Ohio State, I worked at the <u><a href="[https://astronomy.osu.edu/](https://public.nrao.edu/)">National Radio Astronomy Observatory</a></u> who run the absolutely amazing Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), Very Large Array (VLA), and for years rand the Green Bank Telescope. In my opinion NRAO is one of the best institutions and most important assets to US astronomy. I am very excited about the prospect of a Next Generation Very Large Array.

I spent time as a postdoc in Heidelberg at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, which is a fantastic center for all sorts of astronomical research, and continue to collaborate closely with scientists there.
