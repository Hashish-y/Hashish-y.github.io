I am a faculty member in the <u><a href="https://astronomy.osu.edu/">[Department of Astronomy]</a></u> at Ohio State University. We run a collaborative, collegial department. A scientific centerpiece of our department is our daily <u><a href="https://astronomy.osu.edu/talks/astro-coffee">Astronomy Coffee</a>.</u> 

Before joining Ohio State, I worked at the <u><a href="[https://astronomy.osu.edu/](https://public.nrao.edu/)">National Radio Astronomy Observatory</a></u> who run the absolutely amazing Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (<u><a href="https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/alma/">ALMA</a></u>), Very Large Array (<u><a href="https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/vla/">VLA</a></u>), and for years ran the <u><a href="https://public.nrao.edu/telescopes/gbt/">Green Bank Telescope</a></u>. In my opinion NRAO is one of the best institutions and most important assets to US astronomy. I am very excited about the prospect of a <u><a href="https://public.nrao.edu/ngvla/">Next Generation Very Large Array</a></u>.

I spent time as a postdoc in Heidelberg at the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy, which is a fantastic center for all sorts of astronomical research, and continue to collaborate closely with scientists there.
