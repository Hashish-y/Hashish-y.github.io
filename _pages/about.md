Hey! I'm Hashish, working professional at Qualcomm as SoC Design Engineer. Just as the MOSFET switches between states, modulating the flow of current with precision, I’ve navigated the phases of my journey, from learning foundational concepts to tackling complex VLSI challenges. With each step, like adjusting the gate voltage, I unlock new potential and drive my path forward, shaping the circuits of my career with both control and creativity.

I am deeply fascinated by the complex world of VLSI (Very-Large-Scale Integration) design, I am especially drawn to the optimization of SoC architectures, low-power design, and automation of verification workflows. As I continue to grow in my career within the VLSI industry, my goal is to contribute to the advancement of chip design and integration, pushing the boundaries of efficiency and performance in cutting-edge semiconductor technologies.

When I'm not diving into the world of circuits and code, you’ll likely find me speeding down cycling trails, binge-watching my favorite movies and shows, or chasing after the next adventure on my bucket list.
