Hey! I'm Hashish, a SoC Design Engineer at Qualcomm. Just as the MOSFET switches between states, modulating the flow of current with precision, I’ve navigated the phases of my journey, from learning foundational concepts to tackling complex VLSI challenges. With each step, like adjusting the gate voltage, I unlock new potential and drive my path forward, shaping the circuits of my career with both control and creativity.

I’m particularly passionate about optimizing SoC architectures, advancing low-power design techniques, and refining the integration processes that push the boundaries of efficiency in semiconductor technology. As I continue to grow in my career, my goal is to contribute to the advancement of chip design, pushing the boundaries of efficiency and performance in cutting-edge semiconductor technologies.

When I'm not diving into the world of circuits and code, you’ll likely find me speeding down cycling trails, binge-watching my favorite movies and shows, or chasing after the next adventure on my bucket list.
