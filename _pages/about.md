Hello! I'm Swetha Arumugam, an undergrad majoring in Electrical Engineering. Like a voyage through uncharted galaxies, my path may have begun with electrons and circuits, but it soon led me to explore the enigmatic realm of astronomy. 

I am particularly drawn to the captivating realms of Compact Objects and Gravitational Waves (GWs) studied across various spectra like Radio and X-ray. As I look ahead to the pursuit of a Ph.D. in Astronomy, my overarching goal is to make meaningful contributions to the understanding of the universe's most enigmatic processes.

I am an associate member of the Indian Pulsar Timing Array Consortium (InPTA), where we used pulsar timing array (PTA) experiments to detect nanoHertz Gravitational Waves. You can learn more about the work we do [here](https://inpta.iitr.ac.in/){:target="_blank"}.
