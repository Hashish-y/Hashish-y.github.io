I keep a relatively up-to-date list of my refereed publications in <u><a href="https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/yCgLIpG3RZqg_6Tz41O1gw">this public NASA ADS library</a>.</u>  .

We also keep a list of PHANGS publications <u><a href="[https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/public-libraries/yCgLIpG3RZqg_6Tz41O1gw](https://sites.google.com/view/phangs/publications)">here</a>.</u>
